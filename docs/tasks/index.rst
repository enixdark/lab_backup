Role and Tasks 
==============

Role and Tasks 're basic unit in ansible.

A Role 's collection tasks. the Task 's a function to do something on server ( add user, etc ).

Currently, we 'll have all 4 tasks:

- Create, Delete user.
- Update ssh-key on server. 
- Manage user to create all folder for each user.
- Backup mongo database.
